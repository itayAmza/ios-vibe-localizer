# iOS Vibe Localization

A GitHub Action that translates iOS apps using AI, built on top of string catalogs.

## Overview

Xcode 15 introduced [String Catalogs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/localizing-and-varying-text-with-a-string-catalog) – a new unified, auto-updating translations file designed to set an alternative to the legacy `.strings` files pattern.

This GitHub Action leverages OpenAI's Completions API to automatically and continuously keep your string catalogs up-to-date with translations across multiple languages.
This action runs a job that reviews your string catalog, looks for modifications, calls the OpenAI, and finally opens a Pull Request with the translated catalog.

## Features

- **Automated Translation**: Translates missing strings in your String Catalog (`.xcstrings`) files using OpenAI's Completions API
- **Smart Detection**: Only translates strings that are missing or need updates
- **Batch Processing**: Efficiently processes multiple strings and languages in single API calls
- **Comment Support**: Uses String Catalog comments as context for more accurate translations
- **Selective Translation**: Respects `shouldTranslate: false` ('DON'T TRANSLATE') flag to skip specific strings
- **Stale Cleanup**: Automatically removes outdated strings marked as `stale`
- **Pull Request Integration**: Creates organized PRs with detailed change summaries
- **Placeholder Preservation**: Maintains string interpolation placeholders (e.g., `%@`, `%d`) in translations

## Prerequisites

Before using this action, you'll need:

1. **OpenAI API Key**: Obtain an OpenAI API key and store it as a Repository secret (Under repo settings → Security → Secrets and variables → Actions)
2. **Actions Permissions**: Enable 'Read and write permissions' and 'Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests' under Actions in the repo settings.
3. **String Catalog**: An existing `.xcstrings` file in your iOS project (generated by Xcode 15 or newer). To get started with string catalogs, follow this [Apple Developer article](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/localizing-and-varying-text-with-a-string-catalog).

## Usage

Add the following workflow file to your iOS project at `.github/workflows/ios-vibe-localization.yml`:

```yaml
name: iOS Vibe Localization
on:
  push:
    branches:
        - main
    pull_request:
        - main

jobs:
  localize:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: iOS Vibe Localization
        uses: eilonkr/ios-vibe-localization@v1.0.0
        with:
          xcstrings_file_path: 'Localizable.xcstrings' # Path to your String Catalog in your project
          source_language: 'en' # Optional: source locale for Text; when omitted, the key is used
          target_languages: 'es,fr,de,ja,ko' # Customize as needed
          openai_model: 'gpt-4o-mini' # Customize as needed
          base_system_prompt: 'You are translating for a fitness app. Use casual, motivational language.' # An additional system prompt for LLM context (optional)
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        env:
          OPENAI_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
```

## Working with String Catalogs

### SwiftUI

Any literal string in SwiftUI text components will be automatically added to the string catalog (`.xcstrings`) file:

```swift
Text("The sunrise was particularly beautiful today.") // Will be added to the string catalog
```

To provide context for the translation API, add comments that will be reflected in the string catalog and used as context for translations:

```swift
Text("Save your progress", comment: "Button text for saving user data")
```

For strings outside of views (such as in view models or enums), use `LocalizedStringResource`:

```swift
enum Animal {
    case rabbit
    case dog
    case goose
    
    var name: LocalizedStringResource {
        switch self {
        case .rabbit:
            "Rabbit"
        case .dog:
            "Dog"
        case .goose:
            LocalizedStringResource("Goose", comment: "Bird species name")
        }
    }
}
```

**Ignoring strings**: In the string catalog, 'Mark as "Don't translate"' for strings will be ignored by this action

### UIKit

For UIKit projects, use the `String(localized:)` API, which also supports comments for context:

```swift
let welcomeMessage = String(localized: "Welcome to our app!", comment: "Greeting shown on app launch")
```

**Important**: Make sure to build your project with Xcode after adding new strings to ensure your string catalog is synchronized with your project's localizable strings.

## Important Considerations

⚠️ **AI Token Usage and Costs**: This action uses OpenAI's API to generate translations, which may consume significant tokens depending on the number of strings and target languages. While optimized, translation costs can accumulate quickly, especially for large projects, frequent updates or expensive model selection. 

**The developer of this action is not responsible for any OpenAI API charges incurred through its use.** Please monitor your OpenAI usage and set appropriate billing limits in your OpenAI account to avoid unexpected charges.

Consider using this action judiciously by:
- Testing with a small subset of languages first
- Setting up OpenAI usage alerts
- Reviewing the number of strings to be translated before running the action
- Using specific file paths rather than translating entire catalogs when possible


## Roadmap

🤖 **Additional LLM Providers**: Support for Claude, DeepSeek, and other language models

📚 **Multiple Catalog Tables**: Support for multiple string tables within a single catalog ([learn more](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/localizing-and-varying-text-with-a-string-catalog))

👥 **Pluralization Support**
